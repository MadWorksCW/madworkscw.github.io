Contributing
============

... is easy!  Just [fork this repository](https://github.com/MadWorksCW/madworkscw.github.io/fork), make some changes, and then issue a pull request back once you're happy.  Odds are if you're thinking of helping out you already know how to do this, and you've already talked to someone about contributing.

We're using [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) as a CSS precompiler, but everything else is plain old HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.  We want to keep the site responsive and easily accessible via mobile devices, so keep that in mind.  Also, we're thinking of keeping it to a single page for as long as possible mostly to keep it simple. 

Thanks!
