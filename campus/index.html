    <h2>About Madworks at Campus</h2>
    <p>
    Madworks is a seed accelerator operating in the heart of the University of Wisconsin- Madison Campus that provides grants, mentors, lean start-up, structure, access to next round finance, and much, much more to selected early stage companies.
    </p>

    <p>
    The mission of Madworks is to help you succeed.   Do your potential customers believe your idea is good and solves a real problem? Do they want it and will they pay for it????? Following lean startup methodology, startups are encouraged to “build, measure, learn” as quickly as possible. We look for the best people that have the ability to turn ideas into companies. We’ll provide you with capital, office space and surround you with fellow entrepreneurs, mentors, industry experts, service providers and anyone else you need to get off the ground and grow. This happens during a high-energy 10-week program.
    </p>

    <p>
    Madworks accepts early stage companies created by UW Madison faculty, staff, alumni and students as well as early stage companies from the greater Madison community.
