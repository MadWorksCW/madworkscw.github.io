    Our summer accelerator is based on best practices of lean start-up. If selected you 
    and your team will work with our staff and mentors in seeking verification of the 
    commercial viability of your business model. We will work with you in setting 
    milestones which will provide access to additional capital for your efforts. At 
    summers end we will seek an additional round of funding.
