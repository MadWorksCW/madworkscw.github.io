    <h2 class='question'>What is the Madworks Device Lab?</h2>
    <p>
      In short, it's a place where a variety of internet connected devices
      (smartphones, tablets, computers) are kept together as a testing ground for
      web sites and mobile apps.
    </p>
    <p>
      Open Device Laps (ODLs) are a grass roots
      community movement that establish shared pools of devices for use by web
      and app developers, since the cost of owning so many devides is
      prohibitive for small firms, startups, and independent developers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madworks Device Lab is the ninth ODL in the United States, and the first
      and only ODL in Wisconsin. More on ODLs at: <a
