      Brian has been writing software professionally for over a decade and his mobile development experience dates back to the pre-iPhone era when we works on GPS-based applications for dumphones.  He is also in charge of Madworks and you'll often find him hacking the raspberry pi or mining for Dogecoin after hours.<dd>
